Ventoy is an open source tool to create bootable USB drive for ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files, by copying the bootable image files to the USB drive and boot them directly.

It also supports plugins for persistence, theming, and more.

Till now, this is the best tool I have ever tried for this task, as far as it regards versatility and ease of use.
