# Termux on Android

Termux is a Linux terminal emulator that runs on Android in a sort of chroot.

## Installation and first steps

You can install it from the Play Store or the F-Droid app.

After doing that, I usually install some packages with the following command:

```
apt install termux-am vim
```

Then I give storage authorization by running:

```
termux-setup-storage
```
