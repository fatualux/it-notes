# How to Create Linux Symlinks for Files and Directories

In Linux, symbolic links, or symlinks, are a powerful tool for file management. 

They are essential in the file system, facilitating efficient file organization and streamlined workflows.

## What Are Symbolic Links in Linux?

Symbolic links are Linux files that point to another file or directory. They serve as shortcuts, providing quick access to the target file without duplication. Unlike a hard link, a symlink contains not the data of the target file but a path to it.

Symlinks provide flexibility and efficiency in file management by pointing to the file’s location, which can be anywhere in the system. This makes symlinks useful for referencing files across directories or file systems.

They are convenient for creating easy access points to frequently used files or directories, eliminating the need to copy or move the original files.

## What's the Difference Between Soft Links and Hard Links?

Soft links and hard links both create shortcuts to files in different ways.

|   TYPE        |                                                                          DESCRIPTION                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soft Link** | Pointer to the original file, containing only the path leading to it and allowing for links to files on a different file system.    |
| **Hard Link** | Creates a direct association with the target file’s data. It acts as a mirror, sharing the same inode number, but doesn’t use additional storage space. |


Hard links are limited to the same file system as the original file. Any changes to a hard link are reflected in the linked file and vice versa, including file permissions.

### Creating Symlinks for Files

You can use either the absolute path (the entire path from the file system’s root) or the relative path (the path relative to the current directory).

```bash
ln -s [target file] [symlink name]
```

### Creating Symlinks for Directories

```bash
ln -s [target directory] [symlink name]
```
