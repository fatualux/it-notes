# Breaking Things

Every Arch Linux user knows the right question is not "Will the whole thing break?"

As far as it concerns my personal experience, the right question is **"When the whole thing breaks, will I be prepared?"**

In this case, *prepared* could mean:

- Proper partition system
- Packages backup system
- Configuration backup system
- Knowledge/experience
- A live image of Arch Linux on a bootable device
